When measuring the activity of MAO-A, the MAO-B activity was inhibited with deprenyl and when measuring the activity of MAO-B the activity of MAO-A was inhibited with clorgylin. Blank samples were produced using TCP to inhibit both of the enzymes. The metabolites were extracted to toluene and read in a β -counter. The results are expressed in relative activity and normalized to the amount of protein in the tissue.

When measuring the activity of MAO-A, the MAO-B activity was inhibited with deprenyl and when measuring the activity of MAO-B the activity of MAO-A was inhibited with clorgylin. Blank samples were produced using TCP to inhibit both of the enzymes. The metabolites were extracted to toluene and read in a β -counter. The results are expressed in relative activity and normalized to the amount of protein in the tissue.

17798596,"Inhibition Assay: A stock solution was prepared using a human MAO-B enzyme (purchased from Aldrich) and a Amplex Red monoamine oxidase assay kit according to a preparation manual. The kit includes a 5x reaction buffer, an Amplex red reagent (1 mg), HRP, DMSO, H2O2, p-tyramine (substrate of MAO-A, B), benzylamine (substrate of MAO-B), clorgiline (inhibitor of MAO-A), and pargyline (inhibitor of MAO-B). Among these reagents in the kit, benzylamine was used as a substrate for MAO-B, and pargyline was used as an MAO-B inhibitor. A solution as overall substrates was prepared as follows. 200 ul of a solution of 1 mg of Amplex red sufficiently dissolved in 200 ul of DMSO, 100 ul of a mixed solution of HRP and 1 ml of a 1x buffer, 200 ul of a solution of benzylamine dissolved in 1.2 ml of dH2O were added to 9.5 ml of a 1x buffer to reach a total volume of 10 mL, which is sufficient for 100 wells. 0.5 ul of a mixture of MAO-B inhibitor pargyline and 1 ml of dH2O was put into each well. First, the activity of MAO-B was determined using 10 uM of the synthesized compound.Â  96 wells were injected with positive and negative types, and the wile type. The positive type included only substrate and hydrogen peroxide, and the negative type included only substrate. For the wild type, corresponding wells were injected with the enzyme, substrate, and MAO-B inhibitor, but with no synthesized compound. Afterward, 2 ul of the synthesized compound (1 mM) was added into each well, and the human MAO-B enzyme was put only into the 1st row of wells. 0.5 ug of the human MAO-B was put into each well along with 100 ul of a 1x buffer. The human MAO-B enzyme was put into the 2nd row of the wells along with 0.5 ul of a pargyline, the MAO-B inhibitor. To reduce an experimental error for accuracy, the test was repeated three times for each compound. After 30 minutes, 100 ul of the substrate solution was added into each well in a darkroom. The test was performed in the darkroom due to light sensitivity of the Amplex reagent. Finally, a total volume of the reaction solution per well reached 200 ul. After about 2 to 3 hours, chromophoric degrees of the samples were measured. A variation in data values for the 1st and 2nd rows of the wells indicates the pure reaction activity of the MAO-B enzyme with the substrate. Using the samples with the synthesized compound the remaining activity of MAO-B after inhibited by the synthesized compound may be determined. This is because the activities of the other enzymes excluding the MAO-B enzyme may be excluded through this method. Compounds with high inhibitory activity at a concentration of 10 uM were screened from among the synthesized compounds at a compound concentration of 10 uM. Afterward, concentration-dependent IC50 values of these compounds may be obtained through an activity assay at different concentrations of 0.001 uM, 0.01 uM, 0.1 uM, 1 uM, and 10 uM.",CHEMBL3943071,nM,96.0,CHEMBL2039,nM,96.0,7.017728766960431,Brc1ccc(-c2nc3ccc(N4CCCCC4)nc3o2)cc1,358.23900000000015,4.642600000000004,0,4,42.160000000000004,2,3,0.6692175075784002,0,False,True,Active

17798593,"Inhibition Assay: A stock solution was prepared using a human MAO-B enzyme (purchased from Aldrich) and a Amplex Red monoamine oxidase assay kit according to a preparation manual. The kit includes a 5x reaction buffer, an Amplex red reagent (1 mg), HRP, DMSO, H2O2, p-tyramine (substrate of MAO-A, B), benzylamine (substrate of MAO-B), clorgiline (inhibitor of MAO-A), and pargyline (inhibitor of MAO-B). Among these reagents in the kit, benzylamine was used as a substrate for MAO-B, and pargyline was used as an MAO-B inhibitor. A solution as overall substrates was prepared as follows. 200 ul of a solution of 1 mg of Amplex red sufficiently dissolved in 200 ul of DMSO, 100 ul of a mixed solution of HRP and 1 ml of a 1x buffer, 200 ul of a solution of benzylamine dissolved in 1.2 ml of dH2O were added to 9.5 ml of a 1x buffer to reach a total volume of 10 mL, which is sufficient for 100 wells. 0.5 ul of a mixture of MAO-B inhibitor pargyline and 1 ml of dH2O was put into each well. First, the activity of MAO-B was determined using 10 uM of the synthesized compound.Â  96 wells were injected with positive and negative types, and the wile type. The positive type included only substrate and hydrogen peroxide, and the negative type included only substrate. For the wild type, corresponding wells were injected with the enzyme, substrate, and MAO-B inhibitor, but with no synthesized compound. Afterward, 2 ul of the synthesized compound (1 mM) was added into each well, and the human MAO-B enzyme was put only into the 1st row of wells. 0.5 ug of the human MAO-B was put into each well along with 100 ul of a 1x buffer. The human MAO-B enzyme was put into the 2nd row of the wells along with 0.5 ul of a pargyline, the MAO-B inhibitor. To reduce an experimental error for accuracy, the test was repeated three times for each compound. After 30 minutes, 100 ul of the substrate solution was added into each well in a darkroom. The test was performed in the darkroom due to light sensitivity of the Amplex reagent. Finally, a total volume of the reaction solution per well reached 200 ul. After about 2 to 3 hours, chromophoric degrees of the samples were measured. A variation in data values for the 1st and 2nd rows of the wells indicates the pure reaction activity of the MAO-B enzyme with the substrate. Using the samples with the synthesized compound the remaining activity of MAO-B after inhibited by the synthesized compound may be determined. This is because the activities of the other enzymes excluding the MAO-B enzyme may be excluded through this method. Compounds with high inhibitory activity at a concentration of 10 uM were screened from among the synthesized compounds at a compound concentration of 10 uM.

17798585,"Inhibition Assay: A stock solution was prepared using a human MAO-B enzyme (purchased from Aldrich) and a Amplex Red monoamine oxidase assay kit according to a preparation manual. The kit includes a 5x reaction buffer, an Amplex red reagent (1 mg), HRP, DMSO, H2O2, p-tyramine (substrate of MAO-A, B), benzylamine (substrate of MAO-B), clorgiline (inhibitor of MAO-A), and pargyline (inhibitor of MAO-B). Among these reagents in the kit, benzylamine was used as a substrate for MAO-B, and pargyline was used as an MAO-B inhibitor. A solution as overall substrates was prepared as follows. 200 ul of a solution of 1 mg of Amplex red sufficiently dissolved in 200 ul of DMSO, 100 ul of a mixed solution of HRP and 1 ml of a 1x buffer, 200 ul of a solution of benzylamine dissolved in 1.2 ml of dH2O were added to 9.5 ml of a 1x buffer to reach a total volume of 10 mL, which is sufficient for 100 wells. 0.5 ul of a mixture of MAO-B inhibitor pargyline and 1 ml of dH2O was put into each well. First, the activity of MAO-B was determined using 10 uM of the synthesized compound.Â  96 wells were injected with positive and negative types, and the wile type. The positive type included only substrate and hydrogen peroxide, and the negative type included only substrate. For the wild type, corresponding wells were injected with the enzyme, substrate, and MAO-B inhibitor, but with no synthesized compound. Afterward, 2 ul of the synthesized compound (1 mM) was added into each well, and the human MAO-B enzyme was put only into the 1st row of wells. 0.5 ug of the human MAO-B was put into each well along with 100 ul of a 1x buffer. The human MAO-B enzyme was put into the 2nd row of the wells along with 0.5 ul of a pargyline, the MAO-B inhibitor. To reduce an experimental error for accuracy, the test was repeated three times for each compound. After 30 minutes, 100 ul of the substrate solution was added into each well in a darkroom. The test was performed in the darkroom due to light sensitivity of the Amplex reagent. Finally, a total volume of the reaction solution per well reached 200 ul. After about 2 to 3 hours, chromophoric degrees of the samples were measured. A variation in data values for the 1st and 2nd rows of the wells indicates the pure reaction activity of the MAO-B enzyme with the substrate. Using the samples with the synthesized compound the remaining activity of MAO-B after inhibited by the synthesized compound may be determined. This is because the activities of the other enzymes excluding the MAO-B enzyme may be excluded through this method. Compounds with high inhibitory activity at a concentration of 10 uM were screened from among the synthesized compounds at a compound concentration of 10 uM. Afterward, concentration-dependent IC50 values of these compounds may be obtained through an activity assay at different concentrations of 0.001 uM, 0.01 uM, 0.1 uM, 1 uM, and 10 uM.",CHEMBL3979032,nM,410.0,CHEMBL2039,nM,410.0,6.3872161432802645,c1ccc(-c2nc3ccc(N4CCCC4)nc3o2)cc1,265.3159999999999,3.490000000000002,0,4,42.160000000000004,2,3,0.7109821866890841,0,True,True,Active

17802874,"Fluorescence-Based (Inhibitor)-Screening Assay: In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescence-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropanamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAO-A and MAO-B activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Each experiment was performed in duplicate within the same experiment.Briefly, a fixed amount of MAO (0.25 ug for MAO-A and 0.5 ug for MAO-B) was incubated on ice for 15 minutes in the reaction buffer, in the absence and/or in the presence of at least eight 3-fold serial dilutions each. Clorgyline and Deprenyl (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a control for specific inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B respectively. After leaving the enzyme(s) interacting with the inhibitor, KM of kynuramine was added to each reaction for MAO-B and MAO-A assay respectively, and the reaction was left for 1 hour at 37° C. in the dark. The oxidative deamination of the substrate was stopped by adding 50 uL of NaOH 2N. The conversion of kynuramine to 4-hydroxyquinoline, was monitored by fluorescence (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 360 nm) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Arbitrary units were used to measure levels of fluorescence produced in the absence and/or in the presence of inhibitor. The maximum of oxidative deamination activity was obtained by measuring the amount of 4-hydroxyquinoline formed from kynuramine deamination in the absence of inhibitor and corrected for background fluorescence in the absence of MAO enzymes.

16286103,"Fluorescent-Based (Inhibitor) Screening Assay: Human recombinant monoamine oxidase proteins MAO-A and MAO-B were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. MAOs catalyze the oxidative deamination of 1, 2 and 3 amines. In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescent-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropamamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAOs activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5.

17802885,"Fluorescence-Based (Inhibitor)-Screening Assay: In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescence-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropanamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAO-A and MAO-B activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Each experiment was performed in duplicate within the same experiment.Briefly, a fixed amount of MAO (0.25 ug for MAO-A and 0.5 ug for MAO-B) was incubated on ice for 15 minutes in the reaction buffer, in the absence and/or in the presence of at least eight 3-fold serial dilutions each. Clorgyline and Deprenyl (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a control for specific inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B respectively. After leaving the enzyme(s) interacting with the inhibitor, KM of kynuramine was added to each reaction for MAO-B and MAO-A assay respectively, and the reaction was left for 1 hour at 37° C. in the dark. The oxidative deamination of the substrate was stopped by adding 50 uL of NaOH 2N. The conversion of kynuramine to 4-hydroxyquinoline, was monitored by fluorescence (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 360 nm) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Arbitrary units were used to measure levels of fluorescence produced in the absence and/or in the presence of inhibitor. The maximum of oxidative deamination activity was obtained by measuring the amount of 4-hydroxyquinoline formed from kynuramine deamination in the absence of inhibitor and corrected for background fluorescence in the absence of MAO enzymes.

In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescent-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropamamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAOs activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5.

17798597,"Inhibition Assay: A stock solution was prepared using a human MAO-B enzyme (purchased from Aldrich) and a Amplex Red monoamine oxidase assay kit according to a preparation manual. The kit includes a 5x reaction buffer, an Amplex red reagent (1 mg), HRP, DMSO, H2O2, p-tyramine (substrate of MAO-A, B), benzylamine (substrate of MAO-B), clorgiline (inhibitor of MAO-A), and pargyline (inhibitor of MAO-B). Among these reagents in the kit, benzylamine was used as a substrate for MAO-B, and pargyline was used as an MAO-B inhibitor. A solution as overall substrates was prepared as follows. 200 ul of a solution of 1 mg of Amplex red sufficiently dissolved in 200 ul of DMSO, 100 ul of a mixed solution of HRP and 1 ml of a 1x buffer, 200 ul of a solution of benzylamine dissolved in 1.2 ml of dH2O were added to 9.5 ml of a 1x buffer to reach a total volume of 10 mL, which is sufficient for 100 wells. 0.5 ul of a mixture of MAO-B inhibitor pargyline and 1 ml of dH2O was put into each well. First, the activity of MAO-B was determined using 10 uM of the synthesized compound.Â  96 wells were injected with positive and negative types, and the wile type. The positive type included only substrate and hydrogen peroxide, and the negative type included only substrate. For the wild type, corresponding wells were injected with the enzyme, substrate, and MAO-B inhibitor, but with no synthesized compound. Afterward, 2 ul of the synthesized compound (1 mM) was added into each well, and the human MAO-B enzyme was put only into the 1st row of wells. 0.5 ug of the human MAO-B was put into each well along with 100 ul of a 1x buffer. The human MAO-B enzyme was put into the 2nd row of the wells along with 0.5 ul of a pargyline, the MAO-B inhibitor. To reduce an experimental error for accuracy, the test was repeated three times for each compound. After 30 minutes, 100 ul of the substrate solution was added into each well in a darkroom. The test was performed in the darkroom due to light sensitivity of the Amplex reagent. Finally, a total volume of the reaction solution per well reached 200 ul. After about 2 to 3 hours, chromophoric degrees of the samples were measured. A variation in data values for the 1st and 2nd rows of the wells indicates the pure reaction activity of the MAO-B enzyme with the substrate. Using the samples with the synthesized compound the remaining activity of MAO-B after inhibited by the synthesized compound may be determined. This is because the activities of the other enzymes excluding the MAO-B enzyme may be excluded through this method. Compounds with high inhibitory activity at a concentration of 10 uM were screened from among the synthesized compounds at a compound concentration of 10 uM. Afterward, concentration-dependent IC50 values of these compounds may be obtained through an activity assay at different concentrations of 0.001 uM, 0.01 uM, 0.1 uM, 1 uM, and 10 uM.",CHEMBL3901640,nM,1520.0,CHEMBL2039,nM,1520.0,5.818156412055227,COc1ccc(-c2nc3ccc(N4CCCCC4)nc3o2)cc1,309.36899999999997,3.8887000000000027,0,5,51.39,3,3,0.7344273928712174,0,False,True,Active

17802873,"Fluorescence-Based (Inhibitor)-Screening Assay: In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescence-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropanamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAO-A and MAO-B activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Each experiment was performed in duplicate within the same experiment.Briefly, a fixed amount of MAO (0.25 ug for MAO-A and 0.5 ug for MAO-B) was incubated on ice for 15 minutes in the reaction buffer, in the absence and/or in the presence of at least eight 3-fold serial dilutions each. Clorgyline and Deprenyl (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a control for specific inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B respectively. After leaving the enzyme(s) interacting with the inhibitor, KM of kynuramine was added to each reaction for MAO-B and MAO-A assay respectively, and the reaction was left for 1 hour at 37° C. in the dark. The oxidative deamination of the substrate was stopped by adding 50 uL of NaOH 2N. The conversion of kynuramine to 4-hydroxyquinoline, was monitored by fluorescence (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 360 nm) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Arbitrary units were used to measure levels of fluorescence produced in the absence and/or in the presence of inhibitor. The maximum of oxidative deamination activity was obtained by measuring the amount of 4-hydroxyquinoline formed from kynuramine deamination in the absence of inhibitor and corrected for background fluorescence in the absence of MAO enzymes.

After leaving the enzyme(s) interacting with the inhibitor, KM of kynuramine was added to each reaction for MAO-B and MAO-A assay respectively, and the reaction was left for 1 hour at 37° C. in the dark. The oxidative deamination of the substrate was stopped by adding 50 uL of NaOH 2N. The conversion of kynuramine to 4-hydroxyquinoline, was monitored by fluorescence (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 360 nm) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Arbitrary units were used to measure levels of fluorescence produced in the absence and/or in the presence of inhibitor. The maximum of oxidative deamination activity was obtained by measuring the amount of 4-hydroxyquinoline formed from kynuramine deamination in the absence of inhibitor and corrected for background fluorescence in the absence of MAO enzymes. The IC50 values of each inhibitor were calculated with GraphPad Prism Software.",CHEMBL3900398,nM,2040.0,CHEMBL2039,nM,2040.0,5.690369832574101,NC1CCC(N[C@H]2C[C@@H]2c2ccc(-c3cccc(O)c3)s2)CC1,328.4810000000001,3.8361000000000027,3,4,58.28,4,2,0.7991246399182571,0,False,True,Active

16278363,"Fluorescent-Based (Inhibitor) Screening Assay: Human recombinant monoamine oxidase proteins MAO-A and MAO-B were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. MAOs catalyze the oxidative deamination of 1, 2 and 3 amines. In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescent-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropamamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAOs activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5.

17802877,"Fluorescence-Based (Inhibitor)-Screening Assay: In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescence-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropanamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAO-A and MAO-B activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Each experiment was performed in duplicate within the same experiment.Briefly, a fixed amount of MAO (0.25 ug for MAO-A and 0.5 ug for MAO-B) was incubated on ice for 15 minutes in the reaction buffer, in the absence and/or in the presence of at least eight 3-fold serial dilutions each. Clorgyline and Deprenyl (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a control for specific inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B respectively. After leaving the enzyme(s) interacting with the inhibitor, KM of kynuramine was added to each reaction for MAO-B and MAO-A assay respectively, and the reaction was left for 1 hour at 37° C. in the dark. The oxidative deamination of the substrate was stopped by adding 50 uL of NaOH 2N. The conversion of kynuramine to 4-hydroxyquinoline, was monitored by fluorescence (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 360 nm) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Arbitrary units were used to measure levels of fluorescence produced in the absence and/or in the presence of inhibitor.

17798604,"Inhibition Assay: A stock solution was prepared using a human MAO-B enzyme (purchased from Aldrich) and a Amplex Red monoamine oxidase assay kit according to a preparation manual. The kit includes a 5x reaction buffer, an Amplex red reagent (1 mg), HRP, DMSO, H2O2, p-tyramine (substrate of MAO-A, B), benzylamine (substrate of MAO-B), clorgiline (inhibitor of MAO-A), and pargyline (inhibitor of MAO-B). Among these reagents in the kit, benzylamine was used as a substrate for MAO-B, and pargyline was used as an MAO-B inhibitor. A solution as overall substrates was prepared as follows. 200 ul of a solution of 1 mg of Amplex red sufficiently dissolved in 200 ul of DMSO, 100 ul of a mixed solution of HRP and 1 ml of a 1x buffer, 200 ul of a solution of benzylamine dissolved in 1.2 ml of dH2O were added to 9.5 ml of a 1x buffer to reach a total volume of 10 mL, which is sufficient for 100 wells. 0.5 ul of a mixture of MAO-B inhibitor pargyline and 1 ml of dH2O was put into each well. First, the activity of MAO-B was determined using 10 uM of the synthesized compound.Â  96 wells were injected with positive and negative types, and the wile type. The positive type included only substrate and hydrogen peroxide, and the negative type included only substrate. For the wild type, corresponding wells were injected with the enzyme, substrate, and MAO-B inhibitor, but with no synthesized compound. Afterward, 2 ul of the synthesized compound (1 mM) was added into each well, and the human MAO-B enzyme was put only into the 1st row of wells. 0.5 ug of the human MAO-B was put into each well along with 100 ul of a 1x buffer. The human MAO-B enzyme was put into the 2nd row of the wells along with 0.5 ul of a pargyline, the MAO-B inhibitor. To reduce an experimental error for accuracy, the test was repeated three times for each compound. After 30 minutes, 100 ul of the substrate solution was added into each well in a darkroom. The test was performed in the darkroom due to light sensitivity of the Amplex reagent. Finally, a total volume of the reaction solution per well reached 200 ul. After about 2 to 3 hours, chromophoric degrees of the samples were measured. A variation in data values for the 1st and 2nd rows of the wells indicates the pure reaction activity of the MAO-B enzyme with the substrate. Using the samples with the synthesized compound the remaining activity of MAO-B after inhibited by the synthesized compound may be determined. This is because the activities of the other enzymes excluding the MAO-B enzyme may be excluded through this method. Compounds with high inhibitory activity at a concentration of 10 uM were screened from among the synthesized compounds at a compound concentration of 10 uM.

17802909,"Fluorescence-Based (Inhibitor)-Screening Assay: In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescence-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropanamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAO-A and MAO-B activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Each experiment was performed in duplicate within the same experiment.Briefly, a fixed amount of MAO (0.25 ug for MAO-A and 0.5 ug for MAO-B) was incubated on ice for 15 minutes in the reaction buffer, in the absence and/or in the presence of at least eight 3-fold serial dilutions each. Clorgyline and Deprenyl (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a control for specific inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B respectively. After leaving the enzyme(s) interacting with the inhibitor, KM of kynuramine was added to each reaction for MAO-B and MAO-A assay respectively, and the reaction was left for 1 hour at 37° C. in the dark. The oxidative deamination of the substrate was stopped by adding 50 uL of NaOH 2N. The conversion of kynuramine to 4-hydroxyquinoline, was monitored by fluorescence (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 360 nm) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Arbitrary units were used to measure levels of fluorescence produced in the absence and/or in the presence of inhibitor.

16319153,"Fluorescent-Based (Inhibitor) Screening Assay: Human recombinant monoamine oxidase proteins MAO-A and MAO-B were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. MAOs catalyze the oxidative deamination of 1, 2 and 3 amines. In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescent-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropamamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAOs activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5.

17798601,"Inhibition Assay: A stock solution was prepared using a human MAO-B enzyme (purchased from Aldrich) and a Amplex Red monoamine oxidase assay kit according to a preparation manual. The kit includes a 5x reaction buffer, an Amplex red reagent (1 mg), HRP, DMSO, H2O2, p-tyramine (substrate of MAO-A, B), benzylamine (substrate of MAO-B), clorgiline (inhibitor of MAO-A), and pargyline (inhibitor of MAO-B). Among these reagents in the kit, benzylamine was used as a substrate for MAO-B, and pargyline was used as an MAO-B inhibitor. A solution as overall substrates was prepared as follows. 200 ul of a solution of 1 mg of Amplex red sufficiently dissolved in 200 ul of DMSO, 100 ul of a mixed solution of HRP and 1 ml of a 1x buffer, 200 ul of a solution of benzylamine dissolved in 1.2 ml of dH2O were added to 9.5 ml of a 1x buffer to reach a total volume of 10 mL, which is sufficient for 100 wells. 0.5 ul of a mixture of MAO-B inhibitor pargyline and 1 ml of dH2O was put into each well. First, the activity of MAO-B was determined using 10 uM of the synthesized compound.Â  96 wells were injected with positive and negative types, and the wile type. The positive type included only substrate and hydrogen peroxide, and the negative type included only substrate. For the wild type, corresponding wells were injected with the enzyme, substrate, and MAO-B inhibitor, but with no synthesized compound. Afterward, 2 ul of the synthesized compound (1 mM) was added into each well, and the human MAO-B enzyme was put only into the 1st row of wells. 0.5 ug of the human MAO-B was put into each well along with 100 ul of a 1x buffer. The human MAO-B enzyme was put into the 2nd row of the wells along with 0.5 ul of a pargyline, the MAO-B inhibitor. To reduce an experimental error for accuracy, the test was repeated three times for each compound. After 30 minutes, 100 ul of the substrate solution was added into each well in a darkroom. The test was performed in the darkroom due to light sensitivity of the Amplex reagent. Finally, a total volume of the reaction solution per well reached 200 ul. After about 2 to 3 hours, chromophoric degrees of the samples were measured. A variation in data values for the 1st and 2nd rows of the wells indicates the pure reaction activity of the MAO-B enzyme with the substrate. Using the samples with the synthesized compound the remaining activity of MAO-B after inhibited by the synthesized compound may be determined. This is because the activities of the other enzymes excluding the MAO-B enzyme may be excluded through this method. Compounds with high inhibitory activity at a concentration of 10 uM were screened from among the synthesized compounds at a compound concentration of 10 uM. Afterward, concentration-dependent IC50 values of these compounds may be obtained through an activity assay at different concentrations of 0.001 uM, 0.01 uM, 0.1 uM, 1 uM, and 10 uM.",CHEMBL3982296,nM,5080.0,CHEMBL2039,nM,5080.0,5.29413628771608,CN(Cc1ccccc1)c1ccc2nc(-c3ccc(Cl)cc3)oc2n1,349.821,5.179600000000003,0,4,42.160000000000004,4,4,0.5088084315700923,1,False,False,Active

17802899,"Fluorescence-Based (Inhibitor)-Screening Assay: In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescence-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropanamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAO-A and MAO-B activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Each experiment was performed in duplicate within the same experiment.Briefly, a fixed amount of MAO (0.25 ug for MAO-A and 0.5 ug for MAO-B) was incubated on ice for 15 minutes in the reaction buffer, in the absence and/or in the presence of at least eight 3-fold serial dilutions each. Clorgyline and Deprenyl (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a control for specific inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B respectively. After leaving the enzyme(s) interacting with the inhibitor, KM of kynuramine was added to each reaction for MAO-B and MAO-A assay respectively, and the reaction was left for 1 hour at 37° C. in the dark. The oxidative deamination of the substrate was stopped by adding 50 uL of NaOH 2N. The conversion of kynuramine to 4-hydroxyquinoline, was monitored by fluorescence (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 360 nm) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Arbitrary units were used to measure levels of fluorescence produced in the absence and/or in the presence of inhibitor.

17802875,"Fluorescence-Based (Inhibitor)-Screening Assay: In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescence-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropanamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAO-A and MAO-B activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Each experiment was performed in duplicate within the same experiment.Briefly, a fixed amount of MAO (0.25 ug for MAO-A and 0.5 ug for MAO-B) was incubated on ice for 15 minutes in the reaction buffer, in the absence and/or in the presence of at least eight 3-fold serial dilutions each. Clorgyline and Deprenyl (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a control for specific inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B respectively. After leaving the enzyme(s) interacting with the inhibitor, KM of kynuramine was added to each reaction for MAO-B and MAO-A assay respectively, and the reaction was left for 1 hour at 37° C. in the dark. The oxidative deamination of the substrate was stopped by adding 50 uL of NaOH 2N. The conversion of kynuramine to 4-hydroxyquinoline, was monitored by fluorescence (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 360 nm) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Arbitrary units were used to measure levels of fluorescence produced in the absence and/or in the presence of inhibitor. The maximum of oxidative deamination activity was obtained by measuring the amount of 4-hydroxyquinoline formed from kynuramine deamination in the absence of inhibitor and corrected for background fluorescence in the absence of MAO enzymes.

17798586,"Inhibition Assay: A stock solution was prepared using a human MAO-B enzyme (purchased from Aldrich) and a Amplex Red monoamine oxidase assay kit according to a preparation manual. The kit includes a 5x reaction buffer, an Amplex red reagent (1 mg), HRP, DMSO, H2O2, p-tyramine (substrate of MAO-A, B), benzylamine (substrate of MAO-B), clorgiline (inhibitor of MAO-A), and pargyline (inhibitor of MAO-B). Among these reagents in the kit, benzylamine was used as a substrate for MAO-B, and pargyline was used as an MAO-B inhibitor. A solution as overall substrates was prepared as follows. 200 ul of a solution of 1 mg of Amplex red sufficiently dissolved in 200 ul of DMSO, 100 ul of a mixed solution of HRP and 1 ml of a 1x buffer, 200 ul of a solution of benzylamine dissolved in 1.2 ml of dH2O were added to 9.5 ml of a 1x buffer to reach a total volume of 10 mL, which is sufficient for 100 wells. 0.5 ul of a mixture of MAO-B inhibitor pargyline and 1 ml of dH2O was put into each well. First, the activity of MAO-B was determined using 10 uM of the synthesized compound.Â  96 wells were injected with positive and negative types, and the wile type. The positive type included only substrate and hydrogen peroxide, and the negative type included only substrate. For the wild type, corresponding wells were injected with the enzyme, substrate, and MAO-B inhibitor, but with no synthesized compound. Afterward, 2 ul of the synthesized compound (1 mM) was added into each well, and the human MAO-B enzyme was put only into the 1st row of wells. 0.5 ug of the human MAO-B was put into each well along with 100 ul of a 1x buffer. The human MAO-B enzyme was put into the 2nd row of the wells along with 0.5 ul of a pargyline, the MAO-B inhibitor. To reduce an experimental error for accuracy, the test was repeated three times for each compound. After 30 minutes, 100 ul of the substrate solution was added into each well in a darkroom. The test was performed in the darkroom due to light sensitivity of the Amplex reagent. Finally, a total volume of the reaction solution per well reached 200 ul. After about 2 to 3 hours, chromophoric degrees of the samples were measured. A variation in data values for the 1st and 2nd rows of the wells indicates the pure reaction activity of the MAO-B enzyme with the substrate. Using the samples with the synthesized compound the remaining activity of MAO-B after inhibited by the synthesized compound may be determined. This is because the activities of the other enzymes excluding the MAO-B enzyme may be excluded through this method. Compounds with high inhibitory activity at a concentration of 10 uM were screened from among the synthesized compounds at a compound concentration of 10 uM. Afterward, concentration-dependent IC50 values of these compounds may be obtained through an activity assay at different concentrations of 0.001 uM, 0.01 uM, 0.1 uM, 1 uM, and 10 uM.",CHEMBL3896665,nM,7300.0,CHEMBL2039,nM,7300.0,5.136677139879544,c1ccc(-c2nc3ccc(N4CCCC4)nc3s2)cc1,281.3839999999999,3.9585000000000026,0,4,29.020000000000003,2,3,0.7117143501487778,0,False,True,Active

16266019,"Fluorescent-Based (Inhibitor) Screening Assay: Human recombinant monoamine oxidase proteins MAO-A and MAO-B were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. MAOs catalyze the oxidative deamination of 1, 2 and 3 amines. In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescent-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropamamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAOs activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline.

17802892,"Fluorescence-Based (Inhibitor)-Screening Assay: In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescence-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropanamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAO-A and MAO-B activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Each experiment was performed in duplicate within the same experiment.Briefly, a fixed amount of MAO (0.25 ug for MAO-A and 0.5 ug for MAO-B) was incubated on ice for 15 minutes in the reaction buffer, in the absence and/or in the presence of at least eight 3-fold serial dilutions each. Clorgyline and Deprenyl (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a control for specific inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B respectively. After leaving the enzyme(s) interacting with the inhibitor, KM of kynuramine was added to each reaction for MAO-B and MAO-A assay respectively, and the reaction was left for 1 hour at 37° C. in the dark. The oxidative deamination of the substrate was stopped by adding 50 uL of NaOH 2N. The conversion of kynuramine to 4-hydroxyquinoline, was monitored by fluorescence (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 360 nm) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Arbitrary units were used to measure levels of fluorescence produced in the absence and/or in the presence of inhibitor. The maximum of oxidative deamination activity was obtained by measuring the amount of 4-hydroxyquinoline formed from kynuramine deamination in the absence of inhibitor and corrected for background fluorescence in the absence of MAO enzymes.

17802906,"Fluorescence-Based (Inhibitor)-Screening Assay: In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescence-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropanamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAO-A and MAO-B activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Each experiment was performed in duplicate within the same experiment.Briefly, a fixed amount of MAO (0.25 ug for MAO-A and 0.5 ug for MAO-B) was incubated on ice for 15 minutes in the reaction buffer, in the absence and/or in the presence of at least eight 3-fold serial dilutions each. Clorgyline and Deprenyl (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a control for specific inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B respectively. After leaving the enzyme(s) interacting with the inhibitor, KM of kynuramine was added to each reaction for MAO-B and MAO-A assay respectively, and the reaction was left for 1 hour at 37° C. in the dark. The oxidative deamination of the substrate was stopped by adding 50 uL of NaOH 2N. The conversion of kynuramine to 4-hydroxyquinoline, was monitored by fluorescence (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 360 nm) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Arbitrary units were used to measure levels of fluorescence produced in the absence and/or in the presence of inhibitor. The maximum of oxidative deamination activity was obtained by measuring the amount of 4-hydroxyquinoline formed from kynuramine deamination in the absence of inhibitor and corrected for background fluorescence in the absence of MAO enzymes.

16300199,"Fluorescent-Based (Inhibitor) Screening Assay: Human recombinant monoamine oxidase proteins MAO-A and MAO-B were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. MAOs catalyze the oxidative deamination of 1, 2 and 3 amines. In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescent-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropamamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAOs activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5.

17798589,"Inhibition Assay: A stock solution was prepared using a human MAO-B enzyme (purchased from Aldrich) and a Amplex Red monoamine oxidase assay kit according to a preparation manual. The kit includes a 5x reaction buffer, an Amplex red reagent (1 mg), HRP, DMSO, H2O2, p-tyramine (substrate of MAO-A, B), benzylamine (substrate of MAO-B), clorgiline (inhibitor of MAO-A), and pargyline (inhibitor of MAO-B). Among these reagents in the kit, benzylamine was used as a substrate for MAO-B, and pargyline was used as an MAO-B inhibitor. A solution as overall substrates was prepared as follows. 200 ul of a solution of 1 mg of Amplex red sufficiently dissolved in 200 ul of DMSO, 100 ul of a mixed solution of HRP and 1 ml of a 1x buffer, 200 ul of a solution of benzylamine dissolved in 1.2 ml of dH2O were added to 9.5 ml of a 1x buffer to reach a total volume of 10 mL, which is sufficient for 100 wells. 0.5 ul of a mixture of MAO-B inhibitor pargyline and 1 ml of dH2O was put into each well. First, the activity of MAO-B was determined using 10 uM of the synthesized compound.Â  96 wells were injected with positive and negative types, and the wile type. The positive type included only substrate and hydrogen peroxide, and the negative type included only substrate. For the wild type, corresponding wells were injected with the enzyme, substrate, and MAO-B inhibitor, but with no synthesized compound. Afterward, 2 ul of the synthesized compound (1 mM) was added into each well, and the human MAO-B enzyme was put only into the 1st row of wells. 0.5 ug of the human MAO-B was put into each well along with 100 ul of a 1x buffer. The human MAO-B enzyme was put into the 2nd row of the wells along with 0.5 ul of a pargyline, the MAO-B inhibitor. To reduce an experimental error for accuracy, the test was repeated three times for each compound. After 30 minutes, 100 ul of the substrate solution was added into each well in a darkroom. The test was performed in the darkroom due to light sensitivity of the Amplex reagent. Finally, a total volume of the reaction solution per well reached 200 ul. After about 2 to 3 hours, chromophoric degrees of the samples were measured. A variation in data values for the 1st and 2nd rows of the wells indicates the pure reaction activity of the MAO-B enzyme with the substrate. Using the samples with the synthesized compound the remaining activity of MAO-B after inhibited by the synthesized compound may be determined. This is because the activities of the other enzymes excluding the MAO-B enzyme may be excluded through this method. Compounds with high inhibitory activity at a concentration of 10 uM were screened from among the synthesized compounds at a compound concentration of 10 uM. Afterward, concentration-dependent IC50 values of these compounds may be obtained through an activity assay at different concentrations of 0.001 uM, 0.01 uM, 0.1 uM, 1 uM, and 10 uM.",CHEMBL3967344,nM,8700.0,CHEMBL2039,nM,8700.0,5.060480747381382,Fc1ccc(-c2nc3ccc(N4CCCC4)nc3o2)cc1,283.306,3.629100000000002,0,4,42.160000000000004,2,3,0.7199499143427814,0,False,True,Active

17798603,"Inhibition Assay: A stock solution was prepared using a human MAO-B enzyme (purchased from Aldrich) and a Amplex Red monoamine oxidase assay kit according to a preparation manual. The kit includes a 5x reaction buffer, an Amplex red reagent (1 mg), HRP, DMSO, H2O2, p-tyramine (substrate of MAO-A, B), benzylamine (substrate of MAO-B), clorgiline (inhibitor of MAO-A), and pargyline (inhibitor of MAO-B). Among these reagents in the kit, benzylamine was used as a substrate for MAO-B, and pargyline was used as an MAO-B inhibitor. A solution as overall substrates was prepared as follows. 200 ul of a solution of 1 mg of Amplex red sufficiently dissolved in 200 ul of DMSO, 100 ul of a mixed solution of HRP and 1 ml of a 1x buffer, 200 ul of a solution of benzylamine dissolved in 1.2 ml of dH2O were added to 9.5 ml of a 1x buffer to reach a total volume of 10 mL, which is sufficient for 100 wells. 0.5 ul of a mixture of MAO-B inhibitor pargyline and 1 ml of dH2O was put into each well. First, the activity of MAO-B was determined using 10 uM of the synthesized compound.Â  96 wells were injected with positive and negative types, and the wile type. The positive type included only substrate and hydrogen peroxide, and the negative type included only substrate. For the wild type, corresponding wells were injected with the enzyme, substrate, and MAO-B inhibitor, but with no synthesized compound. Afterward, 2 ul of the synthesized compound (1 mM) was added into each well, and the human MAO-B enzyme was put only into the 1st row of wells. 0.5 ug of the human MAO-B was put into each well along with 100 ul of a 1x buffer. The human MAO-B enzyme was put into the 2nd row of the wells along with 0.5 ul of a pargyline, the MAO-B inhibitor. To reduce an experimental error for accuracy, the test was repeated three times for each compound. After 30 minutes, 100 ul of the substrate solution was added into each well in a darkroom. The test was performed in the darkroom due to light sensitivity of the Amplex reagent. Finally, a total volume of the reaction solution per well reached 200 ul. After about 2 to 3 hours, chromophoric degrees of the samples were measured. A variation in data values for the 1st and 2nd rows of the wells indicates the pure reaction activity of the MAO-B enzyme with the substrate. Using the samples with the synthesized compound the remaining activity of MAO-B after inhibited by the synthesized compound may be determined. This is because the activities of the other enzymes excluding the MAO-B enzyme may be excluded through this method. Compounds with high inhibitory activity at a concentration of 10 uM were screened from among the synthesized compounds at a compound concentration of 10 uM. Afterward, concentration-dependent IC50 values of these compounds may be obtained through an activity assay at different concentrations of 0.001 uM, 0.01 uM, 0.1 uM, 1 uM, and 10 uM.",CHEMBL3954605,nM,9860.0,CHEMBL2039,nM,9860.0,5.006123085058789,CNc1ccc2nc(-c3cccc(F)c3)oc2n1,243.241,3.0706000000000007,1,4,50.95,2,3,0.7510744138132436,0,False,True,Active

17802872,"Fluorescence-Based (Inhibitor)-Screening Assay: In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescence-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropanamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAO-A and MAO-B activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Each experiment was performed in duplicate within the same experiment.Briefly, a fixed amount of MAO (0.25 ug for MAO-A and 0.5 ug for MAO-B) was incubated on ice for 15 minutes in the reaction buffer, in the absence and/or in the presence of at least eight 3-fold serial dilutions each. Clorgyline and Deprenyl (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a control for specific inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B respectively. After leaving the enzyme(s) interacting with the inhibitor, KM of kynuramine was added to each reaction for MAO-B and MAO-A assay respectively, and the reaction was left for 1 hour at 37° C. in the dark. The oxidative deamination of the substrate was stopped by adding 50 uL of NaOH 2N. The conversion of kynuramine to 4-hydroxyquinoline, was monitored by fluorescence (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 360 nm) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Arbitrary units were used to measure levels of fluorescence produced in the absence and/or in the presence of inhibitor. The maximum of oxidative deamination activity was obtained by measuring the amount of 4-hydroxyquinoline formed from kynuramine deamination in the absence of inhibitor and corrected for background fluorescence in the absence of MAO enzymes.

17802903,"Fluorescence-Based (Inhibitor)-Screening Assay: In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescence-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropanamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAO-A and MAO-B activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Each experiment was performed in duplicate within the same experiment.Briefly, a fixed amount of MAO (0.25 ug for MAO-A and 0.5 ug for MAO-B) was incubated on ice for 15 minutes in the reaction buffer, in the absence and/or in the presence of at least eight 3-fold serial dilutions each. Clorgyline and Deprenyl (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a control for specific inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B respectively. After leaving the enzyme(s) interacting with the inhibitor, KM of kynuramine was added to each reaction for MAO-B and MAO-A assay respectively, and the reaction was left for 1 hour at 37° C. in the dark. The oxidative deamination of the substrate was stopped by adding 50 uL of NaOH 2N. The conversion of kynuramine to 4-hydroxyquinoline, was monitored by fluorescence (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 360 nm) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Arbitrary units were used to measure levels of fluorescence produced in the absence and/or in the presence of inhibitor. The maximum of oxidative deamination activity was obtained by measuring the amount of 4-hydroxyquinoline formed from kynuramine deamination in the absence of inhibitor and corrected for background fluorescence in the absence of MAO enzymes.

16341285,"Fluorescent-Based (Inhibitor) Screening Assay: Human recombinant monoamine oxidase proteins MAO-A and MAO-B were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. MAOs catalyze the oxidative deamination of 1, 2 and 3 amines. In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescent-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropamamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAOs activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5.

17802917,"Fluorescence-Based (Inhibitor)-Screening Assay: In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescence-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropanamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAO-A and MAO-B activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Each experiment was performed in duplicate within the same experiment.Briefly, a fixed amount of MAO (0.25 ug for MAO-A and 0.5 ug for MAO-B) was incubated on ice for 15 minutes in the reaction buffer, in the absence and/or in the presence of at least eight 3-fold serial dilutions each. Clorgyline and Deprenyl (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a control for specific inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B respectively. After leaving the enzyme(s) interacting with the inhibitor, KM of kynuramine was added to each reaction for MAO-B and MAO-A assay respectively, and the reaction was left for 1 hour at 37° C. in the dark. The oxidative deamination of the substrate was stopped by adding 50 uL of NaOH 2N. The conversion of kynuramine to 4-hydroxyquinoline, was monitored by fluorescence (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 360 nm) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Arbitrary units were used to measure levels of fluorescence produced in the absence and/or in the presence of inhibitor. The maximum of oxidative deamination activity was obtained by measuring the amount of 4-hydroxyquinoline formed from kynuramine deamination in the absence of inhibitor and corrected for background fluorescence in the absence of MAO enzymes.

17798602,"Inhibition Assay: A stock solution was prepared using a human MAO-B enzyme (purchased from Aldrich) and a Amplex Red monoamine oxidase assay kit according to a preparation manual. The kit includes a 5x reaction buffer, an Amplex red reagent (1 mg), HRP, DMSO, H2O2, p-tyramine (substrate of MAO-A, B), benzylamine (substrate of MAO-B), clorgiline (inhibitor of MAO-A), and pargyline (inhibitor of MAO-B). Among these reagents in the kit, benzylamine was used as a substrate for MAO-B, and pargyline was used as an MAO-B inhibitor. A solution as overall substrates was prepared as follows. 200 ul of a solution of 1 mg of Amplex red sufficiently dissolved in 200 ul of DMSO, 100 ul of a mixed solution of HRP and 1 ml of a 1x buffer, 200 ul of a solution of benzylamine dissolved in 1.2 ml of dH2O were added to 9.5 ml of a 1x buffer to reach a total volume of 10 mL, which is sufficient for 100 wells. 0.5 ul of a mixture of MAO-B inhibitor pargyline and 1 ml of dH2O was put into each well. First, the activity of MAO-B was determined using 10 uM of the synthesized compound.Â  96 wells were injected with positive and negative types, and the wile type. The positive type included only substrate and hydrogen peroxide, and the negative type included only substrate. For the wild type, corresponding wells were injected with the enzyme, substrate, and MAO-B inhibitor, but with no synthesized compound. Afterward, 2 ul of the synthesized compound (1 mM) was added into each well, and the human MAO-B enzyme was put only into the 1st row of wells. 0.5 ug of the human MAO-B was put into each well along with 100 ul of a 1x buffer. The human MAO-B enzyme was put into the 2nd row of the wells along with 0.5 ul of a pargyline, the MAO-B inhibitor. To reduce an experimental error for accuracy, the test was repeated three times for each compound. After 30 minutes, 100 ul of the substrate solution was added into each well in a darkroom. The test was performed in the darkroom due to light sensitivity of the Amplex reagent. Finally, a total volume of the reaction solution per well reached 200 ul. After about 2 to 3 hours, chromophoric degrees of the samples were measured. A variation in data values for the 1st and 2nd rows of the wells indicates the pure reaction activity of the MAO-B enzyme with the substrate. Using the samples with the synthesized compound the remaining activity of MAO-B after inhibited by the synthesized compound may be determined. This is because the activities of the other enzymes excluding the MAO-B enzyme may be excluded through this method.

17798588,"Inhibition Assay: A stock solution was prepared using a human MAO-B enzyme (purchased from Aldrich) and a Amplex Red monoamine oxidase assay kit according to a preparation manual. The kit includes a 5x reaction buffer, an Amplex red reagent (1 mg), HRP, DMSO, H2O2, p-tyramine (substrate of MAO-A, B), benzylamine (substrate of MAO-B), clorgiline (inhibitor of MAO-A), and pargyline (inhibitor of MAO-B). Among these reagents in the kit, benzylamine was used as a substrate for MAO-B, and pargyline was used as an MAO-B inhibitor. A solution as overall substrates was prepared as follows. 200 ul of a solution of 1 mg of Amplex red sufficiently dissolved in 200 ul of DMSO, 100 ul of a mixed solution of HRP and 1 ml of a 1x buffer, 200 ul of a solution of benzylamine dissolved in 1.2 ml of dH2O were added to 9.5 ml of a 1x buffer to reach a total volume of 10 mL, which is sufficient for 100 wells. 0.5 ul of a mixture of MAO-B inhibitor pargyline and 1 ml of dH2O was put into each well. First, the activity of MAO-B was determined using 10 uM of the synthesized compound.Â  96 wells were injected with positive and negative types, and the wile type. The positive type included only substrate and hydrogen peroxide, and the negative type included only substrate. For the wild type, corresponding wells were injected with the enzyme, substrate, and MAO-B inhibitor, but with no synthesized compound. Afterward, 2 ul of the synthesized compound (1 mM) was added into each well, and the human MAO-B enzyme was put only into the 1st row of wells. 0.5 ug of the human MAO-B was put into each well along with 100 ul of a 1x buffer. The human MAO-B enzyme was put into the 2nd row of the wells along with 0.5 ul of a pargyline, the MAO-B inhibitor. To reduce an experimental error for accuracy, the test was repeated three times for each compound. After 30 minutes, 100 ul of the substrate solution was added into each well in a darkroom. The test was performed in the darkroom due to light sensitivity of the Amplex reagent. Finally, a total volume of the reaction solution per well reached 200 ul. After about 2 to 3 hours, chromophoric degrees of the samples were measured. A variation in data values for the 1st and 2nd rows of the wells indicates the pure reaction activity of the MAO-B enzyme with the substrate. Using the samples with the synthesized compound the remaining activity of MAO-B after inhibited by the synthesized compound may be determined. This is because the activities of the other enzymes excluding the MAO-B enzyme may be excluded through this method. Compounds with high inhibitory activity at a concentration of 10 uM were screened from among the synthesized compounds at a compound concentration of 10 uM. Afterward, concentration-dependent IC50 values of these compounds may be obtained through an activity assay at different concentrations of 0.001 uM, 0.01 uM, 0.1 uM, 1 uM, and 10 uM.",CHEMBL3933437,nM,16300.0,CHEMBL2039,nM,16300.0,4.787812395596042,Clc1cccc(-c2nc3ccc(N4CCCC4)nc3o2)c1,299.76099999999997,4.143400000000003,0,4,42.160000000000004,2,3,0.712884644326479,0,False,True,Inactive

16290373,"Fluorescent-Based (Inhibitor) Screening Assay: Human recombinant monoamine oxidase proteins MAO-A and MAO-B were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. MAOs catalyze the oxidative deamination of 1, 2 and 3 amines. In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescent-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropamamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAOs activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5.

16278674,"Fluorescent-Based (Inhibitor) Screening Assay: Human recombinant monoamine oxidase proteins MAO-A and MAO-B were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. MAOs catalyze the oxidative deamination of 1, 2 and 3 amines. In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescent-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropamamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAOs activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5.

16262732,"Fluorescent-Based (Inhibitor) Screening Assay: Human recombinant monoamine oxidase proteins MAO-A and MAO-B were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. MAOs catalyze the oxidative deamination of 1, 2 and 3 amines. In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescent-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropamamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAOs activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5.

17802865,"Fluorescence-Based (Inhibitor)-Screening Assay: In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescence-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropanamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAO-A and MAO-B activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Each experiment was performed in duplicate within the same experiment.Briefly, a fixed amount of MAO (0.25 ug for MAO-A and 0.5 ug for MAO-B) was incubated on ice for 15 minutes in the reaction buffer, in the absence and/or in the presence of at least eight 3-fold serial dilutions each. Clorgyline and Deprenyl (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a control for specific inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B respectively. After leaving the enzyme(s) interacting with the inhibitor, KM of kynuramine was added to each reaction for MAO-B and MAO-A assay respectively, and the reaction was left for 1 hour at 37° C. in the dark. The oxidative deamination of the substrate was stopped by adding 50 uL of NaOH 2N. The conversion of kynuramine to 4-hydroxyquinoline, was monitored by fluorescence (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 360 nm) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Arbitrary units were used to measure levels of fluorescence produced in the absence and/or in the presence of inhibitor. The maximum of oxidative deamination activity was obtained by measuring the amount of 4-hydroxyquinoline formed from kynuramine deamination in the absence of inhibitor and corrected for background fluorescence in the absence of MAO enzymes.

17802884,"Fluorescence-Based (Inhibitor)-Screening Assay: In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescence-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropanamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAO-A and MAO-B activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Each experiment was performed in duplicate within the same experiment.Briefly, a fixed amount of MAO (0.25 ug for MAO-A and 0.5 ug for MAO-B) was incubated on ice for 15 minutes in the reaction buffer, in the absence and/or in the presence of at least eight 3-fold serial dilutions each. Clorgyline and Deprenyl (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a control for specific inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B respectively. After leaving the enzyme(s) interacting with the inhibitor, KM of kynuramine was added to each reaction for MAO-B and MAO-A assay respectively, and the reaction was left for 1 hour at 37° C. in the dark. The oxidative deamination of the substrate was stopped by adding 50 uL of NaOH 2N. The conversion of kynuramine to 4-hydroxyquinoline, was monitored by fluorescence (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 360 nm) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Arbitrary units were used to measure levels of fluorescence produced in the absence and/or in the presence of inhibitor. The maximum of oxidative deamination activity was obtained by measuring the amount of 4-hydroxyquinoline formed from kynuramine deamination in the absence of inhibitor and corrected for background fluorescence in the absence of MAO enzymes. The IC50 values of each inhibitor were calculated with GraphPad Prism Software.",CHEMBL4113884,nM,59090.0,CHEMBL2039,nM,59090.0,4.228486010020333,NC1CC(N[C@H]2C[C@@H]2c2ccccc2)c2ccccc21,264.372,3.276900000000002,2,2,38.05,3,2,0.8925509343673931,0,True,True,Inactive

17802916,"Fluorescence-Based (Inhibitor)-Screening Assay: In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescence-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropanamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAO-A and MAO-B activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Each experiment was performed in duplicate within the same experiment.Briefly, a fixed amount of MAO (0.25 ug for MAO-A and 0.5 ug for MAO-B) was incubated on ice for 15 minutes in the reaction buffer, in the absence and/or in the presence of at least eight 3-fold serial dilutions each. Clorgyline and Deprenyl (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a control for specific inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B respectively. After leaving the enzyme(s) interacting with the inhibitor, KM of kynuramine was added to each reaction for MAO-B and MAO-A assay respectively, and the reaction was left for 1 hour at 37° C. in the dark. The oxidative deamination of the substrate was stopped by adding 50 uL of NaOH 2N. The conversion of kynuramine to 4-hydroxyquinoline, was monitored by fluorescence (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 360 nm) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Arbitrary units were used to measure levels of fluorescence produced in the absence and/or in the presence of inhibitor. The maximum of oxidative deamination activity was obtained by measuring the amount of 4-hydroxyquinoline formed from kynuramine deamination in the absence of inhibitor and corrected for background fluorescence in the absence of MAO enzymes. The IC50 values of each inhibitor were calculated with GraphPad Prism Software.",CHEMBL4106580,nM,65010.0,CHEMBL2039,nM,65010.0,4.18701983396052,NC1CCC(N[C@H]2C[C@@H]2c2ccc(-c3cccc(NS(=O)(=O)N4CCNCC4)c3)cc2)CC1,469.6550000000003,2.6309000000000013,4,5,99.49,7,2,0.4996596973297204,0,False,True,Inactive

17798600,"Inhibition Assay: A stock solution was prepared using a human MAO-B enzyme (purchased from Aldrich) and a Amplex Red monoamine oxidase assay kit according to a preparation manual. The kit includes a 5x reaction buffer, an Amplex red reagent (1 mg), HRP, DMSO, H2O2, p-tyramine (substrate of MAO-A, B), benzylamine (substrate of MAO-B), clorgiline (inhibitor of MAO-A), and pargyline (inhibitor of MAO-B). Among these reagents in the kit, benzylamine was used as a substrate for MAO-B, and pargyline was used as an MAO-B inhibitor. A solution as overall substrates was prepared as follows. 200 ul of a solution of 1 mg of Amplex red sufficiently dissolved in 200 ul of DMSO, 100 ul of a mixed solution of HRP and 1 ml of a 1x buffer, 200 ul of a solution of benzylamine dissolved in 1.2 ml of dH2O were added to 9.5 ml of a 1x buffer to reach a total volume of 10 mL, which is sufficient for 100 wells. 0.5 ul of a mixture of MAO-B inhibitor pargyline and 1 ml of dH2O was put into each well. First, the activity of MAO-B was determined using 10 uM of the synthesized compound.Â  96 wells were injected with positive and negative types, and the wile type. The positive type included only substrate and hydrogen peroxide, and the negative type included only substrate. For the wild type, corresponding wells were injected with the enzyme, substrate, and MAO-B inhibitor, but with no synthesized compound. Afterward, 2 ul of the synthesized compound (1 mM) was added into each well, and the human MAO-B enzyme was put only into the 1st row of wells. 0.5 ug of the human MAO-B was put into each well along with 100 ul of a 1x buffer. The human MAO-B enzyme was put into the 2nd row of the wells along with 0.5 ul of a pargyline, the MAO-B inhibitor. To reduce an experimental error for accuracy, the test was repeated three times for each compound. After 30 minutes, 100 ul of the substrate solution was added into each well in a darkroom. The test was performed in the darkroom due to light sensitivity of the Amplex reagent. Finally, a total volume of the reaction solution per well reached 200 ul. After about 2 to 3 hours, chromophoric degrees of the samples were measured. A variation in data values for the 1st and 2nd rows of the wells indicates the pure reaction activity of the MAO-B enzyme with the substrate. Using the samples with the synthesized compound the remaining activity of MAO-B after inhibited by the synthesized compound may be determined. This is because the activities of the other enzymes excluding the MAO-B enzyme may be excluded through this method. Compounds with high inhibitory activity at a concentration of 10 uM were screened from among the synthesized compounds at a compound concentration of 10 uM. Afterward, concentration-dependent IC50 values of these compounds may be obtained through an activity assay at different concentrations of 0.001 uM, 0.01 uM, 0.1 uM, 1 uM, and 10 uM.",CHEMBL3899811,nM,68200.0,CHEMBL2039,nM,68200.0,4.166215625343521,CN(Cc1ccccc1)c1ccc2nc(-c3cccc(Cl)c3)oc2n1,349.821,5.179600000000002,0,4,42.160000000000004,4,4,0.5088084315700923,1,False,False,Inactive

17802880,"Fluorescence-Based (Inhibitor)-Screening Assay: In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescence-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropanamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAO-A and MAO-B activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Each experiment was performed in duplicate within the same experiment.Briefly, a fixed amount of MAO (0.25 ug for MAO-A and 0.5 ug for MAO-B) was incubated on ice for 15 minutes in the reaction buffer, in the absence and/or in the presence of at least eight 3-fold serial dilutions each. Clorgyline and Deprenyl (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a control for specific inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B respectively. After leaving the enzyme(s) interacting with the inhibitor, KM of kynuramine was added to each reaction for MAO-B and MAO-A assay respectively, and the reaction was left for 1 hour at 37° C. in the dark. The oxidative deamination of the substrate was stopped by adding 50 uL of NaOH 2N. The conversion of kynuramine to 4-hydroxyquinoline, was monitored by fluorescence (excitation at 320 nm, emission at 360 nm) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan). Arbitrary units were used to measure levels of fluorescence produced in the absence and/or in the presence of inhibitor. The maximum of oxidative deamination activity was obtained by measuring the amount of 4-hydroxyquinoline formed from kynuramine deamination in the absence of inhibitor and corrected for background fluorescence in the absence of MAO enzymes.

17798587,"Inhibition Assay: A stock solution was prepared using a human MAO-B enzyme (purchased from Aldrich) and a Amplex Red monoamine oxidase assay kit according to a preparation manual. The kit includes a 5x reaction buffer, an Amplex red reagent (1 mg), HRP, DMSO, H2O2, p-tyramine (substrate of MAO-A, B), benzylamine (substrate of MAO-B), clorgiline (inhibitor of MAO-A), and pargyline (inhibitor of MAO-B). Among these reagents in the kit, benzylamine was used as a substrate for MAO-B, and pargyline was used as an MAO-B inhibitor. A solution as overall substrates was prepared as follows. 200 ul of a solution of 1 mg of Amplex red sufficiently dissolved in 200 ul of DMSO, 100 ul of a mixed solution of HRP and 1 ml of a 1x buffer, 200 ul of a solution of benzylamine dissolved in 1.2 ml of dH2O were added to 9.5 ml of a 1x buffer to reach a total volume of 10 mL, which is sufficient for 100 wells. 0.5 ul of a mixture of MAO-B inhibitor pargyline and 1 ml of dH2O was put into each well. First, the activity of MAO-B was determined using 10 uM of the synthesized compound.Â  96 wells were injected with positive and negative types, and the wile type. The positive type included only substrate and hydrogen peroxide, and the negative type included only substrate. For the wild type, corresponding wells were injected with the enzyme, substrate, and MAO-B inhibitor, but with no synthesized compound. Afterward, 2 ul of the synthesized compound (1 mM) was added into each well, and the human MAO-B enzyme was put only into the 1st row of wells. 0.5 ug of the human MAO-B was put into each well along with 100 ul of a 1x buffer. The human MAO-B enzyme was put into the 2nd row of the wells along with 0.5 ul of a pargyline, the MAO-B inhibitor. To reduce an experimental error for accuracy, the test was repeated three times for each compound. After 30 minutes, 100 ul of the substrate solution was added into each well in a darkroom. The test was performed in the darkroom due to light sensitivity of the Amplex reagent. Finally, a total volume of the reaction solution per well reached 200 ul. After about 2 to 3 hours, chromophoric degrees of the samples were measured. A variation in data values for the 1st and 2nd rows of the wells indicates the pure reaction activity of the MAO-B enzyme with the substrate. Using the samples with the synthesized compound the remaining activity of MAO-B after inhibited by the synthesized compound may be determined. This is because the activities of the other enzymes excluding the MAO-B enzyme may be excluded through this method. Compounds with high inhibitory activity at a concentration of 10 uM were screened from among the synthesized compounds at a compound concentration of 10 uM. Afterward, concentration-dependent IC50 values of these compounds may be obtained through an activity assay at different concentrations of 0.001 uM, 0.01 uM, 0.1 uM, 1 uM, and 10 uM.",CHEMBL3966734,nM,111900.0,CHEMBL2039,nM,111900.0,3.95116991347165,Clc1ccccc1-c1nc2ccc(N3CCCC3)nc2o1,299.76099999999997,4.143400000000003,0,4,42.160000000000004,2,3,0.712884644326479,0,False,True,Inactive

17798598,"Inhibition Assay: A stock solution was prepared using a human MAO-B enzyme (purchased from Aldrich) and a Amplex Red monoamine oxidase assay kit according to a preparation manual. The kit includes a 5x reaction buffer, an Amplex red reagent (1 mg), HRP, DMSO, H2O2, p-tyramine (substrate of MAO-A, B), benzylamine (substrate of MAO-B), clorgiline (inhibitor of MAO-A), and pargyline (inhibitor of MAO-B). Among these reagents in the kit, benzylamine was used as a substrate for MAO-B, and pargyline was used as an MAO-B inhibitor. A solution as overall substrates was prepared as follows. 200 ul of a solution of 1 mg of Amplex red sufficiently dissolved in 200 ul of DMSO, 100 ul of a mixed solution of HRP and 1 ml of a 1x buffer, 200 ul of a solution of benzylamine dissolved in 1.2 ml of dH2O were added to 9.5 ml of a 1x buffer to reach a total volume of 10 mL, which is sufficient for 100 wells. 0.5 ul of a mixture of MAO-B inhibitor pargyline and 1 ml of dH2O was put into each well. First, the activity of MAO-B was determined using 10 uM of the synthesized compound.Â  96 wells were injected with positive and negative types, and the wile type. The positive type included only substrate and hydrogen peroxide, and the negative type included only substrate. For the wild type, corresponding wells were injected with the enzyme, substrate, and MAO-B inhibitor, but with no synthesized compound. Afterward, 2 ul of the synthesized compound (1 mM) was added into each well, and the human MAO-B enzyme was put only into the 1st row of wells. 0.5 ug of the human MAO-B was put into each well along with 100 ul of a 1x buffer. The human MAO-B enzyme was put into the 2nd row of the wells along with 0.5 ul of a pargyline, the MAO-B inhibitor. To reduce an experimental error for accuracy, the test was repeated three times for each compound. After 30 minutes, 100 ul of the substrate solution was added into each well in a darkroom. The test was performed in the darkroom due to light sensitivity of the Amplex reagent. Finally, a total volume of the reaction solution per well reached 200 ul. After about 2 to 3 hours, chromophoric degrees of the samples were measured. A variation in data values for the 1st and 2nd rows of the wells indicates the pure reaction activity of the MAO-B enzyme with the substrate. Using the samples with the synthesized compound the remaining activity of MAO-B after inhibited by the synthesized compound may be determined. This is because the activities of the other enzymes excluding the MAO-B enzyme may be excluded through this method. Compounds with high inhibitory activity at a concentration of 10 uM were screened from among the synthesized compounds at a compound concentration of 10 uM. Afterward, concentration-dependent IC50 values of these compounds may be obtained through an activity assay at different concentrations of 0.001 uM, 0.01 uM, 0.1 uM, 1 uM, and 10 uM.",CHEMBL3969283,nM,1900000.0,CHEMBL2039,nM,1900000.0,2.721246399047171,c1ccc(CNc2ccc3nc(-c4ccccc4)sc3n2)cc1,317.41700000000003,4.970400000000002,1,4,37.81,4,4,0.5772214323520404,0,False,True,Inactive
