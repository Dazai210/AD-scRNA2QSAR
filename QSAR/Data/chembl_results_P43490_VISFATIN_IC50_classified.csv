The compound titrations were performed in a separate dilution plate by serially diluting the compounds in DMSO to make a 100x stock. Buffer A (89 uL) containing 33 nM of NAMPT protein was added to 1 uL of 100x compound plate containing controls (e.g. DMSO or blank). The compound and enzyme mixture was incubated for 15 min at rt, then 10 uL of 10x substrate and co-factors in Buffer A were added to the test well to make a final concentration of 1 uM NAM, 100 pM 5-Phospho-D-ribose 1-diphosphate (PRPP), and 2.5 mM Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at rt, then was quenched with the addition of 11 uL of a solution of formic acid and L-Cystathionine to make a final concentration of 1% formic acid and 10 uM L-Cystathionine.
